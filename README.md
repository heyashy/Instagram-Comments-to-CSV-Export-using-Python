# Export an Instagram Post's comments to a CSV file
This is a simple Python script to scrape the first few comments of your Instagram account

## All you need to run this file is:
* An access token from the facebook Graph API Explorer.
* An Instagram business account

## Install
```
pip install facebook-sdk termcolor

```

The program will generate a csv file for any post. This works great for competitions that may require scraping of large comment sections.
